##  COVID-19 Severity Tracking

### **Objective**  
This project focuses on predicting severe COVID-19 outbreaks by analyzing key data patterns. The ultimate goal is to forecast specific days or areas within a month that are likely to experience heightened severity, enabling stakeholders to take preventive measures in advance.

### **Key Features**
- **Data-Driven Predictions**:  
  - Uses historical COVID-19 data, including infection rates, mobility data, vaccination coverage, and public health metrics.  
  - Machine learning models predict high-severity days or locations.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Heatmaps and time-series graphs highlight severity trends across regions and timeframes.  

- **Preventive Action Recommendations**:  
  - Outputs actionable insights for governments, healthcare providers, and communities to better allocate resources.  

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Cleaning and normalizing datasets for consistent input.  
  - Feature engineering to include variables such as daily new cases, test positivity rates, and vaccination data.  

- **Modeling**:  
  - Algorithms such as Random Forest, LSTM, or Gradient Boosting are applied to forecast future severity.  
  - Models are fine-tuned for high accuracy and robustness.  

- **Technologies Used**:  
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data processing and modeling.  
  - Streamlit for creating an interactive dashboard for presentation
